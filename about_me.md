##"Success is the best excuse"

Hello randompasserby,

Welcome to my blog. My name is Samyak Choudhary. I am a third year, computer science, undergraduate student at IIT Roorkee. "Computer Science", "IIT" - you read that right but the image of me you are currently forming in your mind might not be right. No, I am not the nerd who hunches over a Linux powered laptop coding day in and day out (although I do code once in awhile), no I am not the guy you will see wearing a codechef or hackerearth T-Shirt he won in some coding contest, no I am not the guy building cool mobile apps and games, no I am not the guy who builds stylish websites (this blog is my first web related project and currently I don't have plans of any other),nor am I the guy who dreams of working in an organization where people walk in in shorts and flip-flops and ...


I have great appreciation for the people who can find-replace the "no"s in the above paragraph with "yes"s, yet I have not been able to become one of them. Alas, I am not someone who can sit still. Always itching to come up with something, and do something great, I seem to be doomed with a flow of ideas that never stops. You got an idea to do something new, come to me and I might pinpoint a dozen flaws in the idea (I really love doing so). 


While every human being is smitten by the bug of being rich and successful, I believe life is meaningful only if you are ultra successful. Every individual has his own meaning of success. The word success forces me to envision myself in the ranks of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Michael Dell and the like. They are my heros and I marvel at the inordinate amount of wealth they have created, the business empires they have built and the power they possess.


The religious people of the world might argue that money isn't everything but I canâ€™t help but have it on my mind. Everyone has something that makes them feel happy, for some it might be getting drunk and dancing in parties, for others it might be sitting in the comforts of their living rooms and watching movies, for me it is cash flows. The only thought that puts the low dopamine level of my brain on a rise is that of getting my name in the list of forbes richest entrepreneurs. So, will I be happy if tomorrow Warren Buffett decided to give away a billion dollars to me ? No! I want my earnings to be capped only by my talent.


Most people might label me as a rebel, I assert that I am just a curious person who likes to question everything and everyone. No one should accept what one is told just out of respect for parents or teachers, or out of fear of society. If you are going to do what everyone is doing and believe what everyone else believes, you are going to end up becoming what everyone else is being. Given a situation in which I have to choose between choices I am not able to decide between, I shall go with one that most people won't take just to be somewhere different from the rest.


I read voraciously and most of my time is spent reading articles on Business Insider, Inc, entrepreneur.com, forbes, and lifehack. The articles on entrepreneurship, leadership, and success serve as my daily dose of motivation. They inspire me to try new things, to constantly improve myself, to trust my instincts, to never write off my dreams, to make sacrifices, and to never settle for something good when there is a hope for something great coming up next. You can find my favourite web articles <a> here </a>.


I love books. Paulo Coelho, Dan Brown, George Orwell, Michael Palmer, Lee Child and Robin Sharma are my favourite authors, and if someone was to give me the book bucket challenge, I would list - Winner Stands Alone and Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, 1984 by George Orwell, The count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas, The virgin way by Richard  Branson, The Monk who sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma, and Fortunes of War by Stephen Coonts as the books that have inspired me the most. I have an inexhaustible interest in thrillers and I view them as the most influential and effective vehicles for imparting the values of individualism. They present an extravagant, open-ended, no-limits vision of human potential. I can go on and on about the books I have read and how they transformed me as a person, you can find them (along with my thoughts after having read them) <a>here</a>.


I am crazy about new technology. 

Keeping up with research world.e

Machine Learning and Data Analytics ... ability to predict future.

Currenty reading about financial engineering and computational investing. Plans of CFA.

I have recently developed an interest in understanding human psycology.

Any time of the day left out after reading books and articles, completing assignments, daily exercise, getting acquainted with new technology, ,and networking is spent towards watching TED talks. You can find my favourite ones <a>here</a>.

So, if you feel like you will like to have a chat with someone .. , have some entreprenuial idea to discuss, need some motivation, feel like discussing life challenges, or feel like ... you can feel free to <a>contact me</a>.*

I will close by quoting a quote by steve jobs :

"Heres to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
